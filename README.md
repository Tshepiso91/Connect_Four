**Connect 4 Game**

This repository contains the source code for a Connect 4 game, where two players take turns placing their colored discs in a 6x7 grid. The objective is to connect four of their discs in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line before the opponent does. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features:**

- Grid Layout: The game features a 6x7 grid layout for players to place their discs.
- Player Indication: The current player is indicated at the top of the game interface.
- Winning Detection: The game checks for winning combinations after each player's move and displays the winner when a player connects four discs.
- Invalid Moves: The game prevents players from placing discs on top of already taken positions.

**How to Play:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect4-game.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the Connect 4 game.

3. Players take turns clicking on the grid cells to place their discs.

4. The game will display the winner when a player connects four discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Game Logic Refactoring (Opt2):**

The code provides two different approaches to creating the Connect 4 game. The second approach uses a revised version using built-in JavaScript functions.
